            Technology & finance are not culturally agnostic. The future of
            blockchain is global distribution which requires global
            representation by regional validators. Regional validator hotspots
            contribute to decentralized infrastructure. We are establishing and
            acquiring local validators in regions globally. By leveraging our
            technical experience and brand, we are finding the qualified local
            partners with specialized GTM expertise. Our network of validators
            will share best practices & assure a layer of quality control.

            Web3. Our approach combines the best of both worlds â€“ the
            reliability and user experience of traditional web applications with
            the decentralized, transparent nature of blockchain technology. Our
            DApps are designed to empower users with greater control and
            security, paving the way for a more interconnected and efficient
